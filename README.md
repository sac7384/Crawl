# Crawl
A small text based dungeon crawler game. I worked on this project during the winter break in December 2023 and January 2024. This project was a dungeon crawler RPG where you act in battle using items in your inventory. The only thing you can do in battles is use items, so you need to manage what items you use and how much durability you use on those items to not run out of options. Each enemy drops one of its items on death and it is possible for enemies to use up powerful consumable items so it is beneficial to kill those enemies early. There are four enemies and a handul of items/actions per enemy and you face stronger enemies as you win more battles

This game spawned out of my desire for a game which heavily relied on item use and strategically managing your inventory. Like my other early RPG projects this one was only worked on for a short time, but I think it still did what I wanted it to do and is still enjoyable for me to play despite how bare in content it is. The code could definitely use improvements though

To compile (Using the GNU c++ compiler): g++ -o main.exe crawl.cpp

To run: ./main.exe
